# deprecated-2017-dot.vim
> *Please be aware:* This repo was formerly named 'dot.vim.git' and reachable
via https://github.com/simonschiele/dot.vim/. I took the freedom to rename and
start over (breaking history/compatibility and therefore breaking repo
'dot.vim'). The repo got so badly cluttered and I only moved around some local
branches for a few months. And as I see it, these kind of repos are public for
picking, not to clone and use. So hopefully no one ever relies on this anyway
:-)

## Simons old vim config

vimrc, a few custom functions, plugins as subrepos, ...
